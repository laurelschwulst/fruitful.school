It happens wherever you are as long as you have a computer with a stable internet connection. The workshop will run for 6.5 weeks total and will meet synchronously twice a week: Wednesday evenings 7–8pm EST and Sunday afternoons 12–3pm EST. <br><br>Dates for Winter 2021 session: 2.7, 2.10, 2.14, 2.17, 2.21, 2.24, 2.28, 3.3, 3.7, 3.10, 3.14, 3.17, 3.21.</span></p>

We view learning as a lifelong process, and we are excited to see how your previous experiences will inform what you create.</span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">🍇</span> What's Fruitful School’s approach to remote learning during the global pandemic? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> With care, optimism, and realness.<br><br>

                        We think it is up to us (the students, teachers, and guests of Fruitful School) to accept that the pandemic and remote learning is hard but also as an opportunity to be a portal to some new world. we are truly living and breathing the medium (websites!) in new and important ways with more people around the world.
                        <br><br>

                        We also want to continue to remember that we’re in a public health crisis. Let’s be empathetic to each other since none of us are truly "ok." We want to cultivate a caring, understanding, and supportive learning environment.<br><br>

                        We'll be limiting prolonged screen time in the workship itself. We'll be splitting up our meetings into two shorter sessions that re-occur weekly for 6 weeks. We'll be providing just as much synchronous work as asynchronous work. See you with your fruit and water ( stay hydrated! )</span></p>


                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">🍇</span> What will we do during each synchronous session? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> Lectures, discussions, demos/exercises, class workshopping and guidance.</span></p>

                        We're interested in building a sustainable school — one that can continue over the years.<br><br>

                        We have  dreams for Fruitful School to be a place for many different ways to learn beyond the workshop. In the future, we would like to grant more people access to our materials — both free and paid versions. By taking a workshop, you support us to continue Fruitful School.

                    </span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">🍇</span> Will there be future workshops? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> Yes. Subscribe for more updates.</span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">🍇</span> Will there be other ways to get involved? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> We're currently working on ways for people to get involved outside the workshop. We'll be making guides for our asynchronous learning materials. Think “class without the class” — a digital publication you can follow at your own pace.<br><br>

                        We are currently working on the guides. Subscribe for updates.</span></p>

We’re hoping this can be a home to cultivate new ways of publishing to the www.<br><br>

                        We think this skill is even more needed than ever before. We are excited the workshop can be more accessible to those around the world through remote learning.

              <p><b>What is your site?</b></p>
        
              <p>
                It’s a hypothetical & imaginary institution that can soothe all my
                complaints floating up in my mind as I attend classes in art school and
                the greater education system.
              </p>
        
              <p><b>Wow, an institution. Seems like a big project!</b></p>
        
              <p>
                In my mind, this is a long-term project that may be able to realize
                finally when I’m older — in my 40’s or 50’s. So this website is a
                cornerstone which can work as an empty courtyard in that place.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s like I’m writing a possible scenario, and this website is the first
                step: setting up the stage and arranging it. It’s very important for me
                to build up tangibility on each step.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>What did you learn through creating the site?</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                I consider front-end coding a tool which I can use for drawing,
                sculpting, and writing — a way to deliver my thoughts to the public.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, coding languages have also disappointed me by the lack of my
                capacity. But I know I'm free to find a solution by searching, being
                lost, and sometimes asking to someone specific I know. I love trial and
                error. It gives me strength to stay awake.
              </p>
              <p>
                Personally, I like cruising in thoughts while looking at some shapes and
                structures. Some architectural sites or artifacts that are left as
                traces. And building up a website is easy, takes less energy and risk to
                build up such a trace. Very effective, and so much fun when you share,
                of course.
              </p>
