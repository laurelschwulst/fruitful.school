        <p>
          If you search for ‚Äúlightweight websites‚Äù on the web, you will come across very utilitarian definitions of what lightweight sites are ‚Äî <a href="https://512kb.club" target="_blank">small</a> or even <a href="https://1mb.club">smaller</a> in file size. This is great ‚Äî as we are all for a web that is quickly loading, good for the environment, and accessible ‚Äî but this is a very literal definition.
      </p>
      <p>
          For this workshop, we want to extend the definition of lightweightness to a more literary or feeling-based one. We think lightweightness is about seeing the world in a new way. Maybe Italo Calvino, in the chapter on ‚ÄúLightness‚Äù from his book <i>Six Memos for the Next Millennium</i>, said it best ‚Äî
      </p>
      <blockquote>
          ‚ÄúWhenever humanity seems condemned to heaviness, I think I should fly like Perseus into a different space. I don‚Äôt mean escaping into dreams or into the irrational. I mean that I have to <span>change my approach</span>, <span>look at the world from a different perspective</span>, with a different logic and with <span>fresh methods of cognition</span> and verification. The images of lightness that I seek should not fade away like dreams dissolved by the realities of present and future...‚Äù

    In ‚ÄúUltralight: Lightweight Websites in Time & Place,‚Äù we invite artists, designers, writers, programmers, and anyone else interested to explore websites from lightweight perspectives. Participants will use HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript, and sometimes some physical computing to create lightweight websites that share writing, consider time as a medium, and relate to place through ‚Äúcoding in situ.‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    This three-week workshop is led by by <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/">Laurel Schwulst</a> with guest lectures & workshops by <a href="https://motsuka.com/">Marie Otsuka</a> and <a href="https://www.bnjmnearl.eu/">Benjamin Earl</a>. Each weekly session includes lectures, demonstrations, working time, and dialogue. Participants will explore various approaches, integrated with artistic practice, towards creating a more lightweight, accessible, and sustainable web.

<p><b>What topics are covered?</b></p>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>creating minimum viable website</li>
                <li>basics of HTML & CSS</li>
                <li>introduction to JavaScript through programming on dates & time</li>
                <li>beginning philosophies and principles of web accessibility</li>
                <li>introduction to physical computing</li>
                <li>developing strong concepts & flexible formats</li>
            </ul>

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Do I need any technical experience to join?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            While there are no strict prerequisites, a basic familiarity with HTML and CSS is encouraged. You can start trying them out using the references on Laurel‚Äôs <a href="https://veryinteractive.net/tutorials/index.html">Tutorials</a> page, or any other resources you find.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What is the expected workload over the 3 weeks?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the three weeks, participants will engage in workshop sessions that include demonstrations and working prompts. While there may be opportunities to extend these prompts into personal time, it is up to each participant to decide how much additional work they wish to undertake outside of scheduled workshop hours.
      </p>
        <p>
            <b>What materials are required?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Participants will need a laptop and a text editor, such as VS Code or Sublime Text.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the final workshop session, participants are recommended to purchase / have ready a few physical computing components. We will send the list of components and where we recommend purchasing from upon admission to the workshop.
        </p>
            <b>Who might be good for this workshop?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We imagine this workshop is ideal for anyone interested in experimenting with lightweight websites as an extension of artistic practice. Ideally, you have many ideas and possibly writing ready to share through the format of websites. The workshop includes lectures, demonstrations, and prompts for exploring in and outside of the workshop. Please note that this is not an extensive programming course; the focus is on applying concepts learned in demonstrations rather than in-depth programming instruction.
