          The word “ultralight” simply means “extremely lightweight” —
        </p>
        <p>
          In the physical realm, examples include planes and kites. Some kites are so lightweight they can fly indoors, for instance. While some planes are so lightweight they’ve earned the title “microlight.” Or there’s the subreddit called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/">r/Ultralight</a>, dedicated to lightweight backpacking equipment to ideally make your journey less burdensome …

        From a pragmatic standpoint, light websites have a usefulness — they are quick to load, often accessible by default, and use less energy and resources which can have an impact on the environment. (If you search for “lightweight websites,” you may come across collections of websites that are <a href="https://512kb.club/">small</a> or even <a href="https://1mb.club/">smaller</a> in file size, with few dependencies.)

        “Whenever humanity seems condemned to heaviness, I think I should fly like Perseus into a different space. I don’t mean escaping into dreams or into the irrational. I mean that I have to change my approach, look at the world from a different perspective, with a different logic and with fresh methods of cognition and verification. The images of lightness that I seek should not fade away like dreams dissolved by the realities of present and future...”<br><br>

        Artist Weiyi Li frames her entire practice as one of distillation. From her thesis book Four Hundred Forty Five Pieces of Lightness (2012):<br><br>
        “My work is about removing weight, like a cutter or a distiller. My job is thinning and squeezing things, making them thinner than onion skin and lighter than a feather. Sometimes I suspect that my work is still not light enough. A pixel on screen or a point on paper might still not be light enough. If I can make it lighter, I make it faster, until it becomes suspended ghost images. If I can not make it faster, I simply try to not make it happen, let it be an unspoken sentence staying on somebody's tongue, a gesture remaining motionless like a statue, an action waiting for consequences that will never happen. I keep thinking of a story I heard when I was a child: It was said that in Zhangzhou, China, a monk used a paint brush to draw plum flowers in the air every day. During his life, he never drew anything on paper at all. I always dream about doing something as light as the invisible plum flower he drew.”

        This idea of "increasing surface area" was key to my website design work for <a href="https://artistsspace.org">Artists Space</a>, where I implemented five different modes of entering the archive (pages, images, text, artists, videos)... which was inspired by Artist Space's physical building having two separate entrances — an imporant form of accessibility.

        When I worked with Finnegan Shannon on the website for <a href="http://alt-text-as-poetry.net">Alt Text as Poetry</a>, they said that one important form of accessibility is simply to have something available in many different formats. Some people are podcast people, other people like to read it in a book, for example.

        Many of my favorite projects start with what I call a "generous format." One example is <a href="https://perfume-area.com/">Perfume Area</a>, a collaborative fragrance review project that started as a website (well, a Tumblr at first, to be specific) —
