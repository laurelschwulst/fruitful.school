        <h1>Week 1. Exercise.<br>
        Set up Your Ultralight Homepage</h1>
    </h1>

    <h2>Create Github Account</h2>
        <p>
          Create account on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, if you don't have one already
        </p>
        
        <h2>Download Github Desktop Program</h2>
        <p>
          Download and install <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop</a> (or you can use the command line if you prefer)
        </p>

        <h2>Download the code from my repository</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Go to this <a href="https://github.com/laurelschwulst/ultralight-homepage">repository on Github</a>.<br><br>
            <div class="gray">This is a starter repository for your class homepage.</div></li>
          <li>Click the green "Code" button and under "Clone", choose "Download ZIP"<br><br>
            <div class="gray">Put this code somewhere safe for now, where you can access it soon.</div>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
            Create your own repository
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
            Log into github.com and create a new repository using the link under the + icon in the upper right of the GitHub homepage.
            </li>
        <li>
            Name your repository "ultralight" or something similar.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you've created it, click "Open in Desktop". Make sure to choose a careful or useful location for your local website files, perhaps in your "Sites" folder.
        </li>

        <h2>
            Unzip my code and put it into your new site's folder
        </h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
            Using Finder or your file navigator, find the download from my repository and unzip it.
            </li>
        <li>
            Drag these files and folders into your new site's folder, where you carefully saved it. For me, it's in my "Sites" folder and called "ultralight."
        </li>
        <li>
            If you put the files in the right place, when you open up "Github Desktop" program again, it should be noticing changes, or look visually different than before.
        </li>


        <h2>Open your local index.html in your <b>web browser</b></h2>

        <p>
            When you open this index.html in your web browser, you should see that the url starts with "file:///". This means it's the local version (on your computer).
        </p>
        <p class="gray">
            This is the index.html that is inside your "ultralight" folder on your computer.
        </p>

        <h2>Open the local index.html in your <b>text editor</b></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Look at index.html in your text editor and try making somes small changes, like putting your name, favorite fruit, and favorite website in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Save your changes. Then, refresh the version of the site in your browser to see updates.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2><b>Open Github Desktop</b> and see it notice changes</b></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Github Desktop should have some code highlighted in green (or red) to show what you deleted and added. If this looks good, write some "commit message" in the area where it says "Summary (required)" You could say anything here, but it should be a description of what you changed or did.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press the button "Commit to main".
            </li>
            <li>
                In the upper bar, press the tab "Push origin".
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2><b>Go to the page for this repository on github.com</b> and notice updates</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the page for your repository on github.com.<br><br>
            <div class="gray">should be something like: https://github.com/yourusername/ultralight.</div>
        </li>
        <li>Notice changes that happened recently, if your push was made correctly.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
            Set up <b>Github Pages</b> for your site
        </h2>
        <p class="gray">Github Pages is essentially github's free hosting service for repositories. There is a max file size. Which works well, since this is the ultralight workshop!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On your repository page on github.com, go to "Settings" in the upper bar.</li>
            <li>In the left menu, click "Pages"</li>
            <li>Under "Branch" select "Main" in the dropdown, and then press "Save"</li>
            <li>Wait a minute or two, and then your site should appear at:<br>
                https://yourusername.github.io/ultralight/</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
            Once your site is up, paste the URL in our google doc!
        </h2>
        <p>
                When your site is online, copy and paste the URL into our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sLc-HRxp1hgelyebkY96OSLKRzypxRq4Q4Devg5p2hA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">class google doc</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="gray">
                Thanks! I will soon update it on the class homepage, so all our pages will be linked together!!
            </p>
