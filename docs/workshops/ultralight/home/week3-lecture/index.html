	<!-- Firstly I have my own artistic practice where I make things mostly with computers. Whether that be websites, videos, installations, or most recently lamps. I use this technology because I find that I'm drawn to it's potential and most of what I make is somehow about computers to begin with. I'm mostly interested in where we begin to see the digital and the material worlds begin to collapse onto each other or contrast one another. I find myself mostly pointing out that these two worlds might not be so different after all. -->

				how heavy is a network?</h1>
		</div>
	</section>
	<!-- But today I want to quickly introduce you to a couple of things, firstly it's something you might have heard Laurel talk about which is this Ultralight Computer and secondly I will explain briefly about a method I've been exploring for making digital things called Coding in Situ. -->

	</section>
	<!-- So first I want to pick up a little bit on some things that were talked about in the previous weeks about the materiality of the internet. The internet is ephemeral, processes go on that we don't necessarily think about or will ever even notice because that is the way the technology has been designed. Sometimes smooth things cover up rougher more abrasive things. These things that are covered are usually protocol or systems level, essentially the innerworkings. -->

	<section class="slide">
		<figure>
			<img src="media/ntp.png">
		</figure>
	</section>
	<!-- And I kind of wanted to continue from Marie's presentation last week where we thought really carefully and expansively about time because it leads to the topic that I'll be talking about today which is place. One of my favourite underlying protocols of the internet that lets my computer speak to your computer or someone else's computer in a different country is related to time. The time network protocol is one of the oldest protocols thats still operating on the internet today, it's been in use since 1985. It synchronises time amongst a network of computers. It has a hierachy of computers that begin with an extremely accurate clock, usually a nuclear clock and then spreads out over a network. This means that when I send an email to you, both our computers recognise that it was sent at this time. It also facilitates high frequency trading (sometimes) and GPS.  -->

	<section class="slide">
		<figure>
			<img src="media/atomic-clock.jpg">
		</figure>
	</section>
	<!-- These starting points, these nuclear clocks are very local, situated systems. There are something like 450 clocks around the world, I think theres a few in the US but they are all supposed to keep incredibly accurate time by measuring the deterioration of a caesium atom. All the organisations that have these clocks are measuring time from a specific part of the world that when averaged out will create International Atomic Time, which is what UTC is based upon. -->

	</section>
	<!-- This time protocol is what allows data centres to function. It means that I can make a request from my computer to a server with a hard drive with the files of a website on that are then served to my computers browser. Essentially it means that there can be synchronisation across the globe.  -->

	</section>
		<!-- It's actually fairly simple to see how a computer requests a website from another computer using a terminal command called `traceroute`. Traceroute is a simple piece of software thats built into most apple operating systems I think that allows you to type in a url or an ip address and it will output the different places that the signal bounced between before the website is served to your browser.  -->

	<section class="slide">

			<img src="media/solar-hosting.png">

	</section>
	<!-- There are other ways in which you can begin to engage with the internet in a similar way that begin to ground you in the place it starts/ends. I've been practicing self-hosting for a while now as a way to learn how a server works. Usually, the extrapractice.space website is hosted on a server that sits on my desk. There's a certain pleasure I get knowing that when people visit the XP website they are sending a little message to my little computer to ask for our little website. -->

			<h2>Site Specific<br>
				Local<br>
				Situated<br>
				Placefull<br>
				Contextual<br>
				Contextfull
			</h2>
		</div>
	</section>
	<!-- So I think what I'm trying to reiterate over is that whilst we know that this digital infrastructure is actually incredibly heavy instead of light like we are lead to believe through metaphors such as the cloud (buildings, servers etc), we can begin to engage with that infrastructure once we begin to deal with the networks, their material and their locations. Perhaps it's the opaqueness of the networks material reality that has lead it to become this heavy behemoth that we now know. -->

	<!-- So when the question of lightness was introduced by Laurel, one of the first things that came to my mind is the idea site specificity, placefullness, situatedness and context (something that many things on the internet are often lacking). Perhaps that by engaging with place in a system like the web that is often disclocated from it can first begin to reveal the ways in which things are built and perhaps give us ways to build towards a lighter web. I've been thinking about placefull websites for a while now which is kind of where this idea of coding in situ stems from. -->

	</section>
	<!-- It began as a request from some friends in Italy who asked myself and my friend Kirsten Spruit to make a website for them. These friends are part of a collective called Robida, they live on the border between Italy and Slovenia and their village is literally at the end of the road before the mountains become to steep. The village is mostly uninhabited but they are living there in act they call 'living in the margins'.  -->

	<section class="slide">

			<img src="media/robida-map.png">
		</figure>
	</section>
	<!-- We decided that in order to make this website for a collective who practises a different way of living, we also needed to practise living differently. On the day we arrived in the small village of Topolò, I remember stepping out of the car and being overwhelmed by the sound of birdsong and of water cascading down the valley, the smell of fresh woodland air and the overwhelming feeling of peace. It hit me all at once along with the realisation that we had to translate this into a website. -->

	</section>
	<!-- To ease the uneasiness of a complicated task ahead, we spent the first day or two going for walks around the village and the surrounding mountains and valleys. We visited the caves, we crossed the border and swam in the river next to the waterfalls. We spent a lot of time with the people of the collective and others who were visiting at that time. We drank (a lot) of coffee, we cooked and ate dinner, and we drank and danced together in the evening. As we got to know this place more intimately, the website somehow became harder to visualise but easier to feel.  -->

			“Site Writing is a critical and ethical spatial practice that explores what happens when discussions concerning situatedness and site-specificity enter the writing of criticism, history and theory, and writers reflect on their own subject positions in relation to their particular objects and fields of study, and on how their writing can engage materially with their sites of inquiry and audiences. Drawing out the spatial qualities of these interactions between writers and readers on the one hand, places, artefacts, and texts on the other, includes sites – material, political and conceptual – as well as those remembered, dreamed and imagined.”

	<!-- Guided by this idea of writing ‘in relation to [our] particular objects and fields of study”, we began to ask what might Site Writing might look like if it were to be applied to the practice of writing code. We were writing for a web-site, but how could we take into consideration the material, political and conceptual elements of the site we were within? What might it look like if we were to code in situ? -->

		<!-- As we held these questions in our hands and minds, we continued to immerse ourselves in the life of Topolò. We developed routines and began to notice the sensitivities and peculiarities of the village. We began to feel the presence of different elements and materials that made up this site. We found that we could tell if someone was home by whether there was smoke drifting from their chimney. We learnt that the internet connection for some of the village came through a satellite dish pointed towards the sky and that when it got cloudy, the internet connection got worse. Sensing the weather by browsing the web. -->

	<!-- Eventually we began to code. We began with translation: how can this physical thing be represented by this digital thing? From seasonal changes to daily rhythms to properties of the landscape. Inevitably not all of our ideas materialised, but along the way I began to realise that the process of making this website was never about translation to begin with, it was about creating something that would become part of the space, a site-specific website that fluctuated, adapted and moved along with the patterns of the place. -->

	<!-- The website now, even when I look back after over a year, feels alive. I see the people who are there, the events they are doing, the thoughts they might be having. We designed and developed ways in which the site becomes part of the site, like the choice of colour for each person, the glossary and the journal. We still haven’t finished the site, we’ll be working on it for a while longer and perhaps only when we’re in-situ. But since then I’ve begun searching for a way to turn this short experiment into a practice. A practice of coding in situ. -->

	</section>
	<!-- I've been thinking about how Robin Wall Kimmerer says that 'to be native to a place you must first learn to speak its language'. In this case learning a language is more than literally learning a foreign language but can be more about very intentionally getting to know the rhythms, interactions and life of a space. Whether thats knowing how seasonality effects migration patterns or learning about the architecture of a certain area of the city came to be, the materials that the coffee machine is made from or where a certain musical style developed from but I think it comes down to being quite intentional with your attention.  -->

	<section class="slide">
		<blockquote class="text">
			“....something you thought was one thing is actually two things, and each of those two things is actually ten things, seems like a simple function of the duration and quality of one’s attention.

	<!-- It involves what Jenny Odell mentions in her book when she suggests that when you begin to notice that something you thought in fact was only one thing but then becomes two and then how each of those things are made up of 10 things. It's a deeper dive into something, in this case a site. -->

	<section class="slide">

	</section>
	<!-- Which leads me to what we'll be working with today. This 'Ultralight Computer' is in fact made of parts and whilst it is quite literally lightweight in terms of its physical weight there are also ways in which it could be considered incredibly heavy. It's built from components that were either mined, extracted or physically produced in often ways that are detrimental for the people and places involved in manufacturing. It became part of a global supply chain that is built on top of these extractive resources and eventually could be powered by an energy grid that is mostly likely based on fossil fuels.  -->

	<!-- So whilst I do think when we deal with this computer we are dealing with something that is a lot lighter in effect than most computers that we use on a daily basis, we are still dealing with a technology that is part of a bigger system so can't necessarily considered to be separate from that system. However, just to introduce you quickly to this little computer: It is an ESP32 microcontroller that includes a wifi and bluetooth chip. It has 512kb of RAM and 4MB of storage. So when you begin to think of the computers in this room that usually deal with GBs worth of RAM and sometimes terabytes worth of storage, you can begin to see how this computer is much lighter in size and computing power.  -->

	<!-- This lightweightness of the computer means that it has certain limitations. 4MB of memory would allow us to store  one relatively short but high quality song or 4 seconds of HD video. So when we're working with this computer we'll be dealing with different kinds of parameters than we would do when we work with conventional laptops, desktops or servers. But I think we're here to think about these limitations as potentials and what can be imagined differently. -->

	<section class="slide">
		<figure>
			<img src="media/lilygo-tbat.webp">
		</figure>
	</section>
	<!-- So one of the limitations that I've discovered with this computer that I believe is a potential is that because of its size and power usage, it can be pretty effectivly be charged from a reasonably small battery that in itself can be recharged using solar power. This effectivly means that this little computer doesn't need to be connected to a grid in order to function and can be taken anywhere that there is sunlight. We'll be working mostly inside today so we won't go too much into the specifications of solar power and maybe Marie knows more than I do when it comes to this but I've got a couple of small 5v solar panels here that I can demonstrate how it is really a kind of plug and play system. -->

	<!-- So for today, I would like to think about making a site-specific website. Seeing as the computer we'll be using can exist almost anywhere because of its power and scale. It means we can collect it in a little container such as a bag or a box and make a website that is dedicated to a site. Last week I heard a lot of site specificity in the projects you were coding. -->

			<p>the site will be hosted on the ultralight computer<br>
			the site can be no larger than 1MB</p>
		</div>
	</section>
	<!-- Today we're going to work with 1MB as a limitation for creating a website. Even though we have a 4MB computer, we are going to be using some of that space in order to load up some of the system and libraries that will be used which effectivley limits us to 1MB of working storage. -->

	<!-- This means that all the code, images, sound, videos, gifs and any other files that make up your website will have to total less than 1000 kilobytes in size. This website will be loaded onto these computers in such a way that the computer will begin to send out a small wifi signal and that when we connect to that signal with our phones or our laptops, the computer will send that website to our devices.  -->

			<h1>bits and bytes</h1>
		</div>
	</section>
	<!-- And before we go to this weeks exercise, I'll quickly go into file size and compression here and discuss some tools and techniques that can be used to make lighter things. This might answer the 512kb question that I heard has come up recently. So this is returning to what makes up anything digital. A bit is the lowest scale of a digital file. It's made up of a true or false, an on or off or a 0 or 1. Binary code is built on bits and was one of the first programming languages to be developed that was based upon physical punch cards that were initially used to store programmes that could be input into a mechanical computer.  -->

	<!-- However, we don't deal with bits on our personal computers or smart phones. We deal with bytes. A byte is commonly made up of 8 bits. It is 8 bits because that is what is commonly used to determine a single character of text. To write the shortened version my name I need 24 bits. It looks like this: `01000010 01100101 01101110` (spaces only included for reading). Each of these 8 bit chunks are called 'strings'. With these 8 characters that are involved in a byte, there are 256 different possible combinations when using 0s and 1s. Whilst this is the standard for some ways of for unicode, something like ASCII uses a 7-bit binary code to reproduce characters. For now we'll stick with 8-bit bytes. -->

	<!-- However, binary systems don't measure by the power of 10 which is how we're getting to 1000 bytes. Instead it measures by the power of 2, so first there is one bit, then two bits then 4 bits then 8 bits then 16 bit, 32, 64 , 128 and so on. So whilst a harddrive says it has a kilobyte in it which is 1000 bytes its more likely to be 1024 bytes of space, which is actually known as a kibibyte. Then there is the mebibyte, the gibibyte, the tebibyte, the pebibyte etc etc. -->

	<!-- The reason it scales in this way is something I don't fully understand but it is basically a system to be able to keep on using the same technical specs but just doubling it. So if theres a 4gigbyte harddrive, it will work in the same way as an 8 gigabyte harddrive because the system stays the same. Whereas a 5 gigabyte harddrive might have a different structure entirely. (I think) Therefore, the 512kb question is one of how memory scales. However, it might also be a hint towards an earlier era of broadband connection which initially offered a 512kb per seconds of data stream. -->
