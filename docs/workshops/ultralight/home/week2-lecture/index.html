				Looking at past technology for inspiration: the world wide web was developed in 1989, and <a href="https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">the first website</a> was made public on 23 August 1991. It described hypertext, the underlying mechanism for connecting information on the internet. The website contained no specific styling rules (CSS was not supported) or images and still works as a functioning website today!<sup>2</sup>

			3. As an aside – studying old video game technology can be a fruitful way to understand how engineers were able to maximize expression in compact formats, especially with 8bit composition. Composers simulated having more channels than available by rapidly alternating 2 notes or dynamically switching channels to simulate more instruments. See: designer Daniel Brenners’s <a href="https://video-game-music-museum.vercel.app/" target="_blank">history of video games</a> through the lens of audio technology development. Bitmap fonts and icons, too, exhibited an expressive economy that creatively worked with the limitations of resolution. Type designer Toshi Omagari explores this in his book, <a href="https://tosche.net/non-fonts/arcade-game-typography" target="_blank"><em>Arcade Game Typography</em></a>. Susan Kare’s original <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/81132387/Macintosh-icons" target="_blank">“iconic” icon drawings</a> for the 1984 Macintosh also exhibit how technical constraints don’t necessarily limit creative output. Working with “bits” as a methodology for “lightness” might be a subject of another talk!

				This is a solar-powered website, which means it sometimes goes offline.

				It’s possible to build a setup that prevents the site from going offline – but this also means more infrastructure, and more resources and energy that goes into building that infrastructure. This is what we call embodied energy.<sup>4</sup>

				Our goal was never 100% uptime: it was to change our visitor’s relationship to the internet.

On the supplemental article “<a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/01/how-sustainable-is-a-solar-powered-website/" target="_blank">how sustainable is a solar powered website?</a>”, you can read a detailed analysis on the optimal compromise that takes into account the specific limitations for our setup: embodied energy of solar panels and batteries, balancing uptime and power, the fact that we have readers in both Europe and the United States, the seasonal changes of sunlight in Barcelona over the year, and the longevity of the battery.

				Back when the first website launched, browsers could only render text. Internet access was delivered through dial-up modems and local area networks (LANs) and the maximum speed for modems was 56KB/s. But by 2009, cable internet speeds offered an average 8MB/s, and today, the average internet speed in the states is 227MB/s for desktop, and 111 MB/s for mobile.<sup>6</sup>

			7. In terms of the continued development of internet access, the approach with 5G technology also epitomizes problems with designing for more – while 5G may offer a tenfold increase in speed and a larger number of devices to connect to it, these high frequency waves are weaker, don’t travel as far, and are prone to interference, requiring building denser and redundant infrastructure.

				When working with time, it’s inevitable to consider a time <em>zone</em> (haven’t we all experienced this even more since the pandemic?) Time is different for every region.

			<p>But in a way, time is different for every person. Félix González-Torres’s piece <em>Perfect Lovers</em> pairs two clocks that are initially set to move together, side-by-side. Yet over the course of an exhibition, they may fall out of sync—and eventually, one would inevitably stop before the other.

It is based on the location of the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London; historically, commercial navigational systems depended on British maritime technology. Technically, it is now 102 metres east from the historical meridian due to new coordinate systems developed through satellite data developed in 1984, replacing the Greenwich meridian with an updated International Reference Meridian (IRM).

			9. <em>epoch</em> refers to January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC<br>
			10. Browser behavior can be inconsistent in how it treats dates initialized without a timezone, so it is generally best to define time explicitly.
			11. Even though you may have stored the date/time given a particular timezone offset, the default way it will display to you will still be converted to your local timezone.
			12. The international standard ISO 8601 lists time in the following order: year (YYYY), month (MM), day(DD), hour(HH), minutes(mm), seconds(ss), milliseconds(sss), and timezone offset(Z, or +/- followed by HH:mm).
