          Dear everyone,
        </p>
        <p>
            We have decided to retire Fruitful School. We are so thankful to all our past fruitful participants, guests, and everyone else we met. We truly enjoyed learning together! Our website, www.fruitful.school, will remain online as an archive.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2025, Laurel continues to teach through her new educational umbrella project called <a href="https://ultralight.school" target="_blank">Ultralight School</a>, which took root in her <a href="workshops/ultralight/index.html" target="_blank">2024 fruitful workshop</a> of the same name. It has some exciting classes whose applications are now open —
        </p>
        <p>
            The classes are: 1) <a href="https://ultralight.school/classes/twa/" target="_blank">TWA: Total Work of Art</a> (about shapeshifting one concept into digital, physical, and temporal forms), 2) <a href="https://ultralight.school/classes/sense-to-sense" target="_blank">Sense to Sense</a> (about multisensorial translation), and 3) Walking the Internet (walking tours of NYC's internet infrastructure).
        </p>
        <p>
            Applications are due May 30th — for the first two classes. You are welcome to apply! 
        </p>
