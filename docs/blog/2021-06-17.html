        <b>What‚Äôs it been like since launching rite.house?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's been really interesting to watch the site grow in a natural way. I
        never shared it on social media, so I assume people are finding it
        through word of mouth at this point or through the magic that is the
        internet. Randomly, strangers are still finding it and still submitting
        rituals through the Google form. I also think the comments section of
        the form has been really interesting... like what strangers feel like
        they want to share. People have submitted book recs, recipes, poems. A
        few strangers have said that they came to the site at a low point in
        their lives and that seeing other people's rituals helped them come up
        with something they could be doing everyday. The fact that even one
        person was able to find the website and take something positive away is
        really special.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's funny because I think people who have seen the site assume that I
        must have pretty consistent rituals in my own life. But in reality, I've
        always struggled to keep much of a routine (for better or worse lol).
        Part of me always saw the project as a way to get ideas for how to
        structure my own day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since making the site, I have become better about setting aside
        intentional time away from the computer ‚Äî to be outside or do something
        with my hands ‚Äî and that's been helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How was Fruitful School for you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Fruitful School was probably one of my favorite experiences in 2020 :')
        It made me realize how much I missed learning and also how much
        potential the internet has to be something special and handmade. I had
        built up a lot of resentment towards my computer and really anything
        digital (especially social media) throughout the course of the year, so
        I was so grateful when fruitful helped restore my curiosity online.
      </p>
      <p>
        The course made the act of making a site feel a lot less intimidating. I
        think I‚Äôve always been scared that my code would have to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or
        ‚Äúfinished‚Äù to be published? It felt freeing to publish a bunch of ‚Äúin
        progress‚Äù versions of the site and to recognize that any site will
        always be ‚Äúin progress‚Äù and never finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What type of website would you like to encounter more?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was younger, I felt like I had a place online and everything was
        exciting. I kind of hope the future holds a cuter, more playful, and
        welcoming internet... one where you really want to take up digital space
        again. It would be nice to see websites that feel less permanent or
        websites that make you feel more present / more connected in genuine and
        unique ways.
