        <p><b>What is your site?</b></p>

        <p>
          It‚Äôs a hypothetical & imaginary institution that can soothe all my
          complaints floating up in my mind as I attend classes in art school
          and the greater education system.
        </p>

        <p><b>Wow, an institution. Seems like a big project!</b></p>

        <p>
          In my mind, this is a long-term project that may be able to realize
          finally when I‚Äôm older ‚Äî in my 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs. So this website is a
          cornerstone which can work as an empty courtyard in that place.
        </p>
        <p>
          It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm writing a possible scenario, and this website is the
          first step: setting up the stage and arranging it. It‚Äôs very important
          for me to build up tangibility on each step.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What did you learn through creating the site?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I consider front-end coding a tool which I can use for drawing,
          sculpting, and writing ‚Äî a way to deliver my thoughts to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, coding languages have also disappointed me by the lack of
          my capacity. But I know I'm free to find a solution by searching,
          being lost, and sometimes asking to someone specific I know. I love
          trial and error. It gives me strength to stay awake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally, I like cruising in thoughts while looking at some shapes
          and structures. Some architectural sites or artifacts that are left as
          traces. And building up a website is easy, takes less energy and risk
          to build up such a trace. Very effective, and so much fun when you
          share, of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          About technical issues on my site: There is still an error that I
          can‚Äôt solve on counting the number of people, so I have to come and
          check regularly to clean up the database. Keeping it tidy is a part of
          creating a caring a place.
        </p>
        <p><b>What did you learn from being in fruitful school?</b></p>

        <p>
          I appreciated the linear sequences that came along with fruitful
          school. I had to stay up a whole night and had to wake up too early to
          attend with the distance & time difference, but the massive amount of
          articles and references that were shared pushed me to stay awake.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >What's something you'd like visitors to your site to know that they
            wouldn't otherwise?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The freedom of their being there. You are welcomed to make a mess. You
          are welcomed to stay as long as you can. You are welcomed to play with
          HTML code (that was the funny part I didn‚Äôt expect at first ‚Äî entering
          HTML into the chat works pretty well). You are welcomed to leave some
          messages or curses to me so that I can check when I come to clean up.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Why pansies?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Pansies‚Ä¶ I simply like their faces. There is something brutal about
          their faces. They have a sauvage beauty and are animalistic. I also
          enjoyed breeding pansies in Animal Crossing back in the days.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>What's the significance of the title, "Pens√©e Sauvage"?</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah yes, it‚Äôs important. Since there are obviously not many contents
          contained on the site, it‚Äôs almost like an empty yard. So I think this
          semantic naming can lead you in a decent way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pens√©e Sauvage can literally mean ‚Äúwild pansies‚Äù or ‚Äúwild thought.‚Äù
          There is a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Savage_Mind">book</a> also
          named this. I didn‚Äôt read it, but I like this double meaning or pun.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >What type of website would you like to experience more in the
            future?</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          More space debris. Once I got a mail from someone who found my debris,
          and she introduced me an artist Jasper Spicero (<a
            href="https://jasperspicero.com"
            >https://jasperspicero.com</a
          >). His works may be a good example of what I‚Äôd like to experience
          more. Not only his coding works, but also his object works and video
          installations blow my mind and make me conceive them as a certain
          interaction or image that I can probably find somewhere on the web. He
          deals with a very gentle and subtle layout, a frame. And time. I still
          don‚Äôt know how to call this sensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I have been collecting such references in my Are.na channel, ‚Äú<a
            href="https://www.are.na/yelim-ki/probably-web"
            >Probably Web</a
          >‚Äù. You can feel this by having a glimpse of a series of my
          collection, rather than listening to my desperate explanation.
