        Greetings,
    </p>
    <p>
        Happy December! Today we are announcing our Winter 2024 season of Fruitful School, which will be in-person in NYC in January & February.
    </p>
    <p>
        This season is a little different than those we‚Äôve done previously. What remains the same is our general theme of contemporary artistic practice engaging with the world wide web or technology at large. In other words, you can think of Fruitful School as a workshop for artists, designers, writers, programmers who are curious about how their practice engages with technology today.
    </p>
    <p>
        For our Winter 2024 session, we are excited to announce two separate workshops:
    </p>
    <p>
        The first workshop, ‚Äú<a href="workshops/ultralight/index.html">Ultralight</a>,‚Äù is led by Laurel. It‚Äôs about creating lightweight websites that also consider time & place ‚Äî and explore topics including accessibility, sustainability, and formats. We‚Äôll cover basic HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and a little physical computing. (January 14, 21, & 28)
    </p>
    <p>
        The second workshop, ‚Äú<a href="workshops/npc/index.html">NPC Artist</a>,‚Äù is led by John. It‚Äôs about generative programming for the web ‚Äî exploring the ways contemporary artists and programmers use javascript and other software to enable chance in their practice. (February 4, 11, & 18)
    </p>
    <p>
        Each workshop is three weeks long. Each of the three sessions will happen on Sunday afternoons (1-5pm) at Index Space in NYC (120 Walker Street).
    </p>
    <p>
        Each of these sessions is self-contained; that is, there will be lecture, demonstration, workshop, and sharing all within the course of four hours together. Participants will be present and ready to work during the session and dialogue afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each workshop will also invite guest practioners to lecture and sometimes co-workshop together. For Ultralight, we are welcoming Marie Otsuka and Benjamin Earl, and for NPC Artist, we are excited to have Maya Man and Travess Smalley.
    </p>
    <p>We welcome you to apply.</p>
    <p>
        (APPLY to Ultralight) (APPLY to NPC Artist)
    </p>
    <p>
        See you in 2024,<br><br>
        John & Laurel
