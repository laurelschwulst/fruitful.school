        Recently I gave a <a href="#vcu-talk">talk on Zoom *</a> about the ‚Äúinternet onion,‚Äù an ephemeral project I orchestrated.
    </p>
    <p>
        ‚ÄúThe Life and Death of an Internet Onion‚Äù is an anthology webzine created by my Spring 2019 interactive design class at Yale and centered around written responses to the prompt:
    </p>
    <blockquote style="font-style: italic;">
        What is expressing ‚Äúreal‚Äù love or affirmation about? Is it about effort, thoughtfulness, generosity, something else? What might a thoughtful or generous interface feel or behave like?
    </blockquote>
    <p>  
        You can visit the project here:

    </figure>
    <p>  
        If you don‚Äôt know about the project or haven‚Äôt seen it before, you might be wondering why it looks the way it does ‚Äî very illegible and blurry. You might even wonder what you‚Äôre looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
        That‚Äôs because the project has ‚Äúdied‚Äù or is still in the process of decaying‚Ä¶
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a perennial webzine, meaning it will emerge once per year. It‚Äôs likely decaying now, but you can expect to see some legible version of it online again next summer 2021. When it emerges again, it will be live for 5 weeks: the average lifespan of a non-refrigerated onion. And after those 5 weeks of life, it will again begin its process of gradual decay.
    </p>

    <p>
        So much thought and energy often goes into how something we create goes up, but what about when it comes down?
    </p>
    <p>
        Websites are often assumed to be up and running 100% of the time. Of course, certain websites we depend on for health and knowledge need to be. But in the case of an artistic project, the web medium is inherently performative ‚Äî why not embrace it if it makes sense for the project at hand?
    </p>
    <p>
        In the workshop that followed my talk about the internet onion, my group discussed how often in today‚Äôs day and age, the word ‚Äúperformative‚Äù often implies ‚Äúnot authentic‚Äù ‚Äî that is, superficial and insincere. But actually, some performance is part of love. With the best love, this performance is reciprocal. So the perennial nature of this project fit the content well.

    The onion is decaying by phases because it has to be, given the basic hand-coding HTML and CSS I‚Äôm using. I could write a script, but I‚Äôm lazy, and there won‚Äôt be that many more phases of decay than this, I think to myself. (Although down the line, I‚Äôd like to also degrade the content itself and source code, but that will be in Late Decay.)
</p>
<p>
    But what if more thought and energy were put into tools and interfaces for decay and subtraction in the digital platforms we use more regularly?
</p>
<p>
    In his podcast episode, ‚Äú<a href="https://breakingsmart.substack.com/p/towards-subtractive-social-media">Towards Subtractive Social Media</a>,‚Äù Venkatesh Rao summarizes, ‚ÄúThe set of positive, additive operations you can do on your feed ‚Äî posting, liking, following is large, rich, powerful, and thoughtfully designed, but the set of negative operations is a wasteland.‚Äù He goes on to say that the negative operations, like block or mute, are ‚Äú<b>painfully manual</b>.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
    This reminds me of a feature I‚Äôve dreamed of on both Twitter and Instagram: a conditional mute. That is, what if you don‚Äôt want to hide someone forever? You just need a break for a little while; you don‚Äôt want to forget them entirely. Maybe this button could be called ‚Äútime out with fade-in‚Äù because it would hard mute their posts for a set amount of time and then gradually sprinkle their content back into the feed. You don't need to manually give them another chance, by default they re-appear. <i>You were probably in a bad mood when you muted them first anyways.</i>

    In my writing from a couple years ago about <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/">what websites can be</a>, I cycled through a handful of potential metaphors one could use. One was ‚Äúpuddle.‚Äù I wrote, ‚ÄúPuddles evaporate slowly over time. It might be difficult, but I would love to see a website evaporate slowly, too.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
    Not long after I published my writing, I learned about Anny Li‚Äôs <a href="https://volume-1.org/Triple-Canopy-How-to-Encounter-a-Puddle">meditation on puddles</a>. She asks:
</p>
<blockquote style="color: navy;">
    What can be learned from the humble puddle? I wonder how they could present new models for publication. To this end I think too of Jack Halberstam‚Äôs ‚Äúlow theory‚Äù in <i>The Queer Art of Failure</i>, where he outlines inroads to non-dominant and resistant modes of being, knowing, and learning, recuperating failure as a practice and locating sites of ‚Äúmore creative, more cooperative, more surprising ways of being in the world.‚Äù Similarly, the puddle may lead a precarious existence, but it thrives in these very same in-between, overlooked spaces. A puddle infiltrates, interferes, and ultimately vanishes, only to replenish itself anew.
</blockquote>
<p>
    I would love to see more designers putting energy into decay. Enter, designers of decay & subraction!
</p>
<p>
    If it makes sense for the project, let‚Äôs consider decay just as equally along with growth. And if we‚Äôre working on a tool, can we create features to allow participants to expertly & gracefully embrace subtraction?
</p>
<p>
    How about an ‚Äúevaporate‚Äù button?
