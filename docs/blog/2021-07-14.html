        <b>What‚Äôs your site?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        The ickygoohe.art was a breakup site I made when the wounds were still
        pretty raw, mid-pandemic. I was lonely and sad, and I needed somewhere
        to store my overflowing emotions. The internet seemed like a good place
        for that.
      </p>

      <p>
        The term ‚Äúicky gooey heart chamber‚Äù comes from a conversation I had with
        a friend when we were both gushing about our toxic love lives. We
        commented on how gross falling in love actually is, contrary to its
        fetishization. When I think of hearts, I initially think of the plush
        fuzzy ones teddy bears hold. But in reality, the heart is probably
        pretty slimy and gooey, and the sight of one out of body is really
        macabre. The uncanny image of a physical heart elicits an aura of
        mystery. I liked the idea of making each webpage a different mysterious
        chamber where I could tuck away purged personal memories. It‚Äôs not what
        a typical website looks or feels like, and I really wanted to push that
        uncanny phenomenon.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>What was the process of creating like?</b>
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the first pages I made for the site was based on a reflection I
        had during an insomnia episode. I had a vision of putting all the sweet
        memories with my late ex in a coffin, setting it on fire, and pushing it
        into the abyss. So I literally did that (in CGI), and it made me feel
        much better. From there, the other pages fell into place as I was
        thinking about the site like a game with different levels. How could the
        visitors of the site get from one page to the next without losing
        interest? Many of the elements, like the navigation buttons, I designed
        in a 3D modeling program called Cinema 4D. Sometimes the coding trick I
        wanted to try would inform what I ended up illustrating. Other times, I
        would illustrate something and then figure out how to lay it out on the
        page with code.
      </p>

      <p>
        Making this site was special because a lot of the things I attempted to
        make were with skills I really struggled with months before. When I
        would sit down and figure stuff out, it was really empowering and helped
        me regain confidence in myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the first things John & Laurel talked about was how webpages can
        be interactive digital art books. I really like that approach for
        designing for the internet. So often people make the mistake of teaching
        a skill without the context of how that skill can be applied in a
        meaningful way. A lot of the websites that came out of our fruitful
        cohort were great because everyone already had an idea of the story they
        wanted their site to tell. It was really encouraging to have a group of
        people to sort of hold you accountable for carrying out your creative
        vision. I learned that I love HTML & CSS, and that both are totally
        underrated. You can do so much with both, without a complicated back-end
        or fancy frameworks, and still have very abundant websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        I feel like learning to make websites is like climbing a really tall
        ladder into the clouds. It‚Äôs slow, you have to start at the bottom, and
        it‚Äôs more about the ascension than actually reaching an ending. You have
        to let the ideas guide you.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b
          >What's something you'd like visitors to your site to know that they
          wouldn't otherwise?</b
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        There are little glimpses of me and my digital art everywhere on the
        site. Retrospectively, I think I may have hidden stuff too well.
        Something I would want to tell visitors, just keep clicking around or
        hovering over stuff and eventually you might find something kind of
        cool. There is actually a guest book on one of the pages that remains
        unsigned. It‚Äôs hidden under a love letter on the page where you can see
        yourself on the computer. I was hoping people would screenshot
        themselves on the page and put it in the guest book with mine so I would
        feel less alone. ÃÑ\_(„ÉÑ)_/ ÃÑ
      </p>

      <p>
        <b
          >Since some time has passed, have you had any new feelings / thoughts
          / reflections about your site now, looking back?</b
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The site is pretty emo, so when I look back at some of the stuff I put
        in it and myself in that moment, I‚Äôm like ugh, this is kind of
        embarrassing how dramatic I was or how upset I got over this lame
        person. It‚Äôs like seeing an awkward photo of yourself with an
        out-of-style haircut and feeling like a huge nerd. I guess there is
        something kind of nice about that though. Post fruitful school, I‚Äôve
        been practicing my web development skills, and I would love to revisit
        the vessel of a heart as a web page and go more in depth. Ideally, I
        want to make a collaborative version where other people can contribute
        their own intimate memories.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b
          >What type of website would you like to experience more in the
          future?</b
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Obviously, I want more mystery on the web. We have these set
        expectations of the experience that we‚Äôll have behind the screen when we
        visit a URL. I‚Äôm interested in websites that break those expectations,
        that take time for visitors to understand. I want to revisit webpages
        and discover new things. I want more websites that feel like digital
        worlds. I want to spend as much time on handmade sites as I do now on
        social media. Most interactions I have on social media seem disingenuous
        and I want to see more people using the webpage as a medium for
        expressing themselves honestly.
