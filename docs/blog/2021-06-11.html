      <p><b>What was the process of creating the site like?</b></p>
      <p>
        It went through a lot of iterations. First it was going to be a book, I
        printed all the pictures out in tiny grids and cut them up to sequence
        on the walls. Then I thought it made more sense to be online so I made a
        draft using Cargo Collective, a website building tool, that was a lot
        more linear, just clicking forward through the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In workshop, I was encouraged to lean into the maze aspect of it, so it
        became a little more interactive. The actual code for it ended up being
        pretty bare bones and simple, most of the time went into linking all the
        pages together and building a maze that made enough sense. I had to draw
        out a key for myself so I wouldn't get lost. I wanted the sequence to be
        somewhat associative and wanted the navigation to be frustrating but not
        so frustrating that you give up, just enough to hang on for the dopamine
        hits of more pictures.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>
        <b
          >What's something you'd like visitors to your site to know that they
          wouldn't otherwise?</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite some of these images being really bleak, I actually absolutely
        loved living in Tucson and would move back in a heartbeat!
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the project sorta came full circle. I collected pictures in
        anticipation to move there for longer than I ended up staying (pandemic
        etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It was also a major challenge for me to find steady work out there. I
        would get a ton of gigs and then nothing and it would repeat. Some of
        the more steady work I got was with a guy I met from Craigslist. He and
        his buddy were able to get a loan and started buying these super run
        down trailer homes. I worked to gut and help rebuild them and then he
        would either sell them to people or back to the park. So after
        collecting all these pictures I ended up playing the role of real estate
        photographer. In taking the pictures there was this balance of trying to
        figure out what potential buyers would want to see but then also having
        moments like this one ‚Äî where we wanted to get the posting onto
        Craigslist but hadn‚Äôt found a mirror for cheap enough yet so the room
        just feels a little off.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I also think that‚Äôs a feeling that is understood and respected in
        Tucson. There‚Äôs the general understanding that while the city is
        increasingly gentrifying, the heart of it is pretty scrappy and
        impoverished. At the same time the scrappiness also feeds into a lot of
        liveliness and creativity and I think some of that feeling comes across
        in the pictures. Like someone thinking,
        <span style="background: white"
          >‚Äúinstead of spending money we don‚Äôt have to redo all the bathroom
          tile after a plumbing problem, let‚Äôs just make a path of river rock up
          to the toilet, that‚Äôs character, people will love it.‚Äù</span

        <b
          >What did you learn through creating the site and being in fruitful
          school?</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Wow, so many things! I came to fruitful school with MySpace-level HTML
        literacy and I could not have imagined everything that was possible. I
        think the most difficult part of learning a new language and something
        that can keep you from being fluent in it is not being around other
        people who speak it. Before when I would look up tutorials and stuff, it
        was hard for me to contextualize it all. Having access to a community of
        people who not only work in web making but are also artists and
        designers was so crucial for me to engage and learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would say one of the biggest things I took away from the experience has
        been confidence :-) Fruitful made the web feel much less bleak and
        instead opened my mind to a space of play and exploration. I feel steady
        now in my foundation of starting a site and know more of what to look
        for to get my ideas across, have even been able to do a few freelance
        gigs since. I have stayed eager and energized to continue learning,
        practicing, and code-foraging and am in the process of hand coding a
        group show for
        <a href="https://bluearrangements.com" target="_blank"
          >Blue Arrangements</a
        >, my collaborative publishing project.

      <p>
        <b
          >Have you been collecting any new images (apartment or otherwise)
          lately?</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Always! In terms of found images, still mostly screenshots and mostly on
        Craigslist or eBay.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm really excited about pictures people take of things they are trying
        to get rid of but not throw away and especially images taken by people
        who do not consider themselves photographers, (especially x100 when the
        image taker is also anonymous).
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple months ago, I was on this huge cliff/rock thing on the ocean
        and found a handful of ripped up drug store prints of a middle aged
        person sitting at a table with a lit birthday cake. I still have the
        pieces and feel like I can‚Äôt get rid of them for some reason, even
        though I feel really guilty about it, like someone made a conscious act
        to try and let this person or memory go, yet I can‚Äôt stop myself from
        projecting a story onto it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôve also been collecting every picture I can find of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_window">truth windows</a>.

          >What type of website would you like to experience more in the
          future?</b
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        More websites that collect, connect and archive learning tools in
        accessible ways.
      </p>
      <p>More websites that promote low-stakes creative collaboration.</p>
      <p>More websites that feel like curiosity shops.</p>
