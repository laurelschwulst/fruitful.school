      <p>
        Fruitful School started just recently—
      <p>
        In the first two sessions, we introduced foundational languages for making websites—HTML and CSS, along with some historical context surrounding the web’s beginnings...
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve also been thinking about our own formation as a school. How should we introduce our way of relating and working together? We decided to draft our own <i>Code of Conduct</i>, as you can see here...
      </p>
      <section class="guide">
        <h3>𝒻𝓇𝓊𝒾𝓉𝒻𝓊𝓁 𝒸ℴ𝓃𝒹𝓊𝒸𝓉 ℊ𝓊𝒾𝒹ℯ</h3>


  <b>As we talk to each other at Fruitful School, we are…</b>

  <ul>
  <li>open and free</li>
  <li>trying to “suspend judgement” (don’t attack an idea you don’t like)</li>
  <li>not afraid to share an honest opinion or risky idea</li>
  <li>building on each other’s ideas</li>
  <li>sharing often while respecting others’ time to share</li>
  <li>always trying to help each other create their best work</li>
  </ul>


  <b>and we discourage…</b>

  <ul>
  <li>sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, religious discrimination or otherwise discriminatory actions</li>
  <li>violence in any form</li>
  <li>unwelcome physical contact or hostile attention</li>
  <li>deliberate intimidation or stalking</li>
  <li>advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Tips while presenting work (as the presenter):</b>

  <ul>
  <li>communicate the main idea in as few words as possible</li>
    <ul><li>what are you trying to do/communicate?</ul></li>
  <li>describe where you’re at in the process</li>
    <ul>
      <li>what have you done?</li>
      <li>what is still left to do?</li>
    </ul>
  <li class="special">try not to self deprecate the work at any stage of the process </li>
  <li>leave lots of room for others to speak</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Tips while presenting work (as the group):</b>

  <ul>
  <li>first…</li>
  <ul>
    <li>state the facts</li>
    <li>describe what you see</li>
    <li>describe what you hear</li>
  </ul>
  <li>after…</li>
  <ul>
    <li>describe how YOU feel?</li>
    <li>share any associations …</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top: 3em;">
    We are indebted to the School for Poetic Computation’s Code of Conduct, which they’ve generously shared <a href="https://github.com/SFPC/codeofconduct">here</a>. We used it as a basis for our own.

  <p>
    We also took some inspiration from the guiding rules of a “Bohm Dialogue,” a type of nonjudgemental, generative group exchange started by physicist David Bohm that is essentially sitting in a circle and talking in a group, with a few important rules...

   We learned about Bohm Dialogue from Cab, via his Are.na <a href="https://www.are.na/blog/bohm-dialogue">blog post</a>.

   Note that our conduct guide is a work in progress. We hope to edit it as time goes on, after living by it more and seeing how it feels...
