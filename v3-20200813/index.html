                    🍊 fruitful.school is an independently-run learning initiative for making “fruitful websites” founded in 2020 by Laurel Schwulst and John Provencher.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍊 fruitful.school is dedicated to exploring new ways of publishing together using the www.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍊 For our Fall 2020 workshop, participants will hang out and work together online to self-publish a piece to the www over the course of 6 weeks.

                    🍋 Well... what is a <i>fruitful web</i>?
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> requires seeds. We ask participants to apply with a proposal of their seed, their idea, their content to publish.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> requires soil. Good soil is a point of view, specific perspective, or story. Prior coding experience is a plus, but it’s not required.
                </p>

                <p class="press">
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> is handmade. By learning some basic HTML, we will build a website by hand. <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“In today’s highly commercialized web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications, read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers, it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental web art and writing projects.” <br><br>— J.R. Carpenter</span>
                </p>
                <p class="press">
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> studies the histories and materiality of the web to understand “the web’s grain” and often works along with it. <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“I believe every material has a grain, including the web. But this assumption flies in the face of our expectations for technology. Too often, the internet is cast as a wide-open, infinitely malleable material.” <br><br>— Frank Chimero</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> is visually diverse. We like seeing things we've never seen before. We will learn how to add a presentation layer to our content with CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> flows and changes over time. We will learn basic JavaScript to seek generative opportunities.
                </p>
                <p class="press">
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> aspires to be light, fast, and accessible. We will use only as much energy as we need to. We recognize websites are connected to limited physical resources.
                    <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“Just because things are digital doesn’t mean they’re more sustainable. There are servers that are powered by fossil fuels that serve up these digital documents.” <br><br>— Marie Otsuka speaking on the design of the solar-powered version of the Low Tech Magazine website</span>
                </p>
                <p class="press">
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> can be written. Maybe you can build a text-only website.
                    <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“There is a renaissance underway in online text as a medium.” <br><br>— Venkatesh Rao</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> can be a utility. Perhaps we can make tools for our daily lives.
                </p>

                <p class="press">
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> can be performative. Maybe we can make sites with a purpose and life that’s brief but beautiful. We also recognize that the web is inherently a performative medium by its design.
                    <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“Like theater, CSS is contextual. As a playwright, I know the actors are going to say the lines I wrote in the order I wrote them in the script. But when I write stage direction (like how I think the stage and actors should look and behave), they’re all suggestions. The production company will make their own decisions because they’re working with specific constraints.” <br><br>— Miriam Suzanne</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> can be archival. Perhaps we plant the seed and let it grow, let it collect.
                </p>

                <p class="press">
                    🍋 A <i>fruitful web</i> can be an alternative to corporate social media. Let’s evaluate what’s not working for us.
                    <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“Anyone can set up a web site and point to all the other web pages. Everyone is a publisher. Everyone is a peer. That’s why it’s called a web. Individuals knit themselves together by linking to one another. Everyone tends his or her own little epistemological garden, growing ideas from seed and sharing them with anyone who comes by.” <br><br>— Paul Ford</span>

                <p class="press">🍇 Where and when are classes held? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br>Starting in Fall 2020, the workshop is all virtual. So it happens wherever you are as long as you have a computer with a stable internet connection. The workshop will run for 6 weeks total and will meet synchronously twice a week: on Wednesday evenings 7–9pm EST and Sunday afternoons 1–3pm EST. So on these specific days: Oct 14, Oct 18, Oct 21, Oct 26, Oct 28, Nov 1, Nov 4, Nov 8, Nov 11, Nov 16, Nov 18, and Nov 22.</span></p>

                <p class="press">🍇 Do I need any coding knowledge prior? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> No, but any prior knowledge is a plus.</span></p>

                <p class="press">🍇 Am I too ( insert adjective here ) to learn to code? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> No, it’s never too late to start. We view learning as a lifelong process, and we are excited to see how your previous “unrelated” experiences will inform what you create!</span></p>

                <p class="press">🍇 What's Fruitful School’s approach to remote learning during the global pandemic? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> With care, optimism, and realness.<br><br>

                    We think is up to us (the students, teachers, and guests of Fruitful School) to view the pandemic and remote learning as not only as a setback but also as an opportunity. We see the opportunity as a "portal" to some new world, as now we are finally able to truly live and breathe the medium (websites!) in new and important ways with more people around the world. This doesn’t mean that we’ll be glued to our computers all the time, but it does mean we are interested in experimenting to evolve these mediums in ways that truly work for us. We hope this workshop can be a place to start experimenting around new ways be online and how we engage with others. Since physical interaction is limited, we've been inspired by what people in quarantine have been doing with the web. How can we playfully integrate spatial concepts and co-presence? We are excited to explore these concepts and realms with you all, and we hope you are too.<br><br>
                    
                    We also want to continue to remember that we’re in a public health crisis. Let’s be empathetic to each other since none of us are truly "ok." We want to cultivate a caring, understanding, and supportive learning environment.<br><br>
                    
                    Pragmatically speaking, we are limiting prolonged screen time. We are splitting up our meetings into two shorter sessions a week rather than one longer session. And we are focusing just as much on asynchronous as synchronous communication. We will also make sure to gather while eating real fruit and hydrating properly.</span></p>


                <p class="press">🍇 What will we do during each session? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> Lectures, discussions, workshops, demos, exercises, review, critique, and guidance.</span></p>

                <p class="press">🍇 How many participants do you accept? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> 15 maximum</span></p>

                <p class="press">🍇 How much does it cost? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> $1200 — with the exception of 2 half-priced spots</span></p>

                <p class="press">🍇 Why does it cost this much? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br>
                    
                    The workshop costs money in general because we are interested in building a sustainable school — one that can continue over the years.<br><br>
                    
                    We think the price is fair. It’s cheaper than a similar single course at an institution. But it’s also not free. (We believe there’s no such thing as a free lunch.) We also have 2 half-priced spots for students with special circumstances.<br><br>
                
                    We have more dreams for Fruitful School, too, as we know there are many different ways to learn beyond the workshop. But we are doing the workshop now because it’s a model we understand. In the future, we would like to grant more people access to our materials — both free and paid versions. By taking a workshop, you support us to continue Fruitful School.
                
                </span></p>

                <p class="press">🍇 I can’t make some of those dates for the workshop...<sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> If you want to be seriously considered for the Fall 2020 workshop, we ask that you are able to attend all sessions.<br><br> However, you can still fill out the application and check the checkbox “Consider my application for a future workshop instead” at the end of the application. We will be in touch with you in the future if your application is a fit.</span></p>

                <p class="press">🍇 Will there be future workshops? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> Yes. Please stay tuned for updates.</span></p>

                <p class="press">🍇 What are the guides, and when can I purchase them? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> The guides are our asynchronous learning materials. Think “class without the class” — a digital publication you can follow at mostly your own pace.<br><br>

                    We are currently working on the guides. Stay tuned for updates.</span></p>

                    <p class="press">🍇 Why did you start this school? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> We love talking about, teaching and making websites! We’re hoping this can be a home to cultivate new ways of publishing to the www.<br><br>

                        And now during the pandemic, we think this skill is even more needed than ever before. We are excited the workshop can be more accessible to those around the world through remote learning.<br><br>
                        
                        We also both regularly teach at institutions. We want to explore alternative learning environments with more equitable futures for students and teachers alike.</span></p>
