                    🍊 fruitful.school is an independently-run learning initiative for making “fruitful websites” founded in 2020 by Laurel Schwulst and John Provencher.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍊 fruitful.school is a learning initiative dedicated to exploring new ways of publishing together using the www.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍊 our workshop focuses on ideas for the web that start as seeds and are nurtured over time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍊 for our fall 2020 workshop, participants will hang out and work together online to self-publish a piece to the www over the course of 6 weeks.

                    🍋 well... what is a <i>fruitful web</i>?
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> requires seeds. we ask participants to apply with a proposal of their seed, their idea, their content to publish.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> requires soil. good soil is a point of view, specific perspective, or story. prior coding experience is a plus, but it’s not required for this workshop.
                </p>

                <p class="press">
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> is handmade. by learning some basic html, we will build a website by hand. <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“In today’s highly commercialized web of multinational corporations, proprietary applications, read-only devices, search algorithms, Content Management Systems, WYSIWYG editors, and digital publishers, it becomes an increasingly radical act to hand-code and self-publish experimental web art and writing projects.” — <i>J.R. Carpenter</i></span>
                </p>
                <p class="press">
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> studies the histories and materiality of the web to understand “the web’s grain” and often works along with it. <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“I believe every material has a grain, including the web. But this assumption flies in the face of our expectations for technology. Too often, the internet is cast as a wide-open, infinitely malleable material.” — <i>Frank Chimero</i></span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> is visually diverse. we like seeing things we've never seen before. we will learn how to add a presentation layer to our content with css.
                </p>
                <p>
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> flows and changes over time. we will learn basic javascript to seek generative opportunities.
                </p>
                <p class='press'>
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> aspires to be light, fast, and accessible. we will use only as much energy as we need to. we recognize websites are connected to limited physical resources.
                    <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“A couple years ago, I took a road trip from Wisconsin to Washington and mostly stayed in rural hotels on the way. I expected the internet in rural areas to be slow, but I was still surprised that a large fraction of the web was inaccessible. Some sites with lightweight styling were readable, but very few commercial websites were usable (other than Google).”<br>—<i>Dan Luu</i></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> can be written. maybe you can build a text-only website.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> can be a utility. perhaps we can make tools for our daily lives.
                </p>

                <p class="press">
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> can be performative. maybe we can make sites with a purpose and life that’s brief but beautiful.
                    <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“Like theater, CSS is contextual. As a playwright, I know the actors are going to say the lines I wrote in the order I wrote them in the script. But when I write stage direction (like how I think the stage and actors should look and behave), they’re all suggestions. The production company will make their own decisions because they’re working with specific constraints.”<br>—<i>Miriam Suzanne</i></span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> can be archival. perhaps we plant the seed and let it grow, let it collect.
                </p>

                <p class="press">
                    🍋 a <i>fruitful web</i> can be an alternative to corporate social media. let’s evaluate what’s not working for us.
                    <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(–)</sup>
                    <span class="answer"><br><br>“Anyone can set up a web site and point to all the other web pages. Everyone is a publisher. Everyone is a peer. That’s why it’s called a web. Individuals knit themselves together by linking to one another. Everyone tends his or her own little epistemological garden, growing ideas from seed and sharing them with anyone who comes by.”<br>—<i>Paul Ford</i></span>
