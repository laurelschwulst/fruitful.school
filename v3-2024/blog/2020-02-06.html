          <img src="images/fruitful-happy2.png" alt="A calligraphic script typeface says 'fruitful school class of winter 2020' in a circular formation centered on the poster. The background is a very light gray, #f0f0f0 hex code. In the upper right corner, there is information: 'You're invited to join us for happy hour drinks (both non and alcoholic) at Pioneer Works on Sunday, February 9, 2020, 4-6pm. Our Fruitful School participants' work from the 6 week Winter 2020 program will be on view... see you there!' and in the lower left, '02.09.2020, 4–6pm, Pioneer Works: 159 Pioneer St, Brooklyn, NY 11231'.">

This graph was originally created by curator Clive Phillpot for his book "Booktrek" to diagram different types of artist books but has been repurposed by Fruitful School to show the range of "artist websites" — from website objects to net art to informational websites.">
