                Greetings,
            </p>
            <p>
                Happy December! Today we are excited to announce two separate workshops for our Winter 2024 season of Fruitful School, which will take place in-person at Index Space in NYC.
            </p>
            <p>
                These workshops are different than past workshops in an effort to expand on how contemporary artistic practices engage with the world wide web or technology at large. We want Fruitful School to be a place where artists, designers, writers, and programmers who are curious about how their practice engages with technology today can explore new ways of working.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first workshop, ‚Äú<a href="workshops/ultralight/index.html">Ultralight</a>,‚Äù is led by Laurel. It‚Äôs about creating lightweight websites that also consider time & place ‚Äî and explore topics including accessibility, sustainability, and formats. We‚Äôll cover basic HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and a little physical computing. (January 14, 21, & 28)
            </p>
            <p>
                The second workshop, ‚Äú<a href="workshops/npc/index.html">NPC Artist</a>,‚Äù is led by John. It‚Äôs about generative programming for the web ‚Äî exploring the ways contemporary artists and programmers use javascript and other software to enable chance in their practice. (February 4, 11, & 18)
            </p>
            <p>
                Each workshop is three weeks long and will take place on Sunday afternoons (1-5pm) at Index Space in NYC (120 Walker Street).
            </p>
            <p>
                Each of these sessions is self-contained; that is, there will be lecture, demonstration, workshop, and sharing all within the course of four hours together. Participants will be present and ready to work during the session and dialogue afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each workshop will also invite guest practioners to lecture and sometimes co-workshop together. For Ultralight, we are welcoming Marie Otsuka and Benjamin Earl, and for NPC Artist, we are excited to have Maya Man and Travess Smalley.
            </p>
            <p>We welcome you to apply.</p>
            <p>
                See you in 2024,<br><br>
                John & Laurel
