        <p>
          Greetings,
        </p>
        <!-- <u style="text-decoration-color: red; text-decoration-style: wavy;"> -->
        <p>
          Happy <u style="text-decoration-color: #CA383A; text-decoration-thickness: 4px;">Cyber Monday</u>! Today we are launching “<u style="text-decoration-color: yellow; text-decoration-thickness: 4px;">Fruitful School</u>”, our first independently-run teaching initiative. We were inspired by a few poet friends who offered simple classes from their apartments or via Skype.
        </p>
        <!-- <span class="accordion"><span class="open">(+)</span><span class="content">(like John's <a href="http://webinteraction2019.com/">Web Interaction</a> and my <a href="http://suddenly.rocks">Writing as Metadata</a>)</span> -->
        <p>
          If any of you know John or my previous teaching work, this school differs in that participants must apply with a specific idea proposal — a “seed.” Maybe this seed is an idea about a website container, like a compelling URL or website name. Or maybe it’s a specific piece of content to publish online, but how or in what form is still up in the air. Or maybe it is a totally fully-fledged concept with content and container working together harmoniously, and it’s more about the details of publishing online.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are excited to know participants’ motivations from the very beginning. Each week, we’ll explore a specific aspect of web markup and programming, and each week participants will try manifesting their seed using this aspect. We’ll also have some lectures, demos, sharing, critiques, and mentorship. By the end of the workshop, hopefully all seeds will sprout, or maybe even produce fruit, whatever it means…
        </p>
        <p>
          See you next in 2020,<br>
