    <h1>
        Week 1.<br>
        Lightweight Website
    </h1>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Make your own prompt.<br>
            The prompt should be simple and strong.
        </li>
        <li>
            Following your prompt, <br>
            write a single-page, text-only website.*

            <p class="gray">
                Good design naturally flows from strong content or ideas, so I recommend you <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/words.html" target="_blank">write</a> or compose something original for your site. Or maybe you already brought some text you'd like to present on a site. That's good too.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're not sure what to write, I recommend choosing a favorite photo from your camera roll and describing it, like <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net/">alt-text</a>. Maybe this description is the start of a short story. The writing doesn't need to be long, but ideally it is meaningful or energizing to you somehow.
            </p>
            <p class="gray">
                * If you must add images, make sure they have alt-text. That way, they can be understood if someone is experiencing your website who can‚Äôt see.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            This is a website, so incorporate some interactivity with basic HTML, CSS, and maybe a little JS where it truly makes sense, and flows naturally from your concept.
            <p class="gray">
                If you need any guidance on writing a webpage, here are some <a href="https://veryinteractive.net/tutorials/index.html">tutorials</a>. You can also ask Chat GPT for coding help, but remember to not outsource your heart and soul ...
            </p>
            <p class="gray">
                Affordances like jump links, for example on <a href="https://alt-text-as-poetry.net" target="_blank">this site</a> or <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/dontforgettotakeaselfiewithyourherbs">this other one</a>, can be helpful in navigating a single page. What else can you do with some simple <a href="https://youtu.be/CkzbI1Tv_rQ?si=k9cUPvyf8UZsIM07">HTML</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/BUZIaTHm_oE?si=JLWD5JzvQiJ_yC3z">CSS</a>?
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            At the end of this session or at the beginning of next week's, you are welcome to share your website. I would encourage a reading of your website ‚Äî that is, read aloud your website, or have someone else read it for you. The website should work well both as a reading and as a site.
            <p class="gray">
                It's like how my project of fragrance reviews called ‚ÄúPerfume Area‚Äù started with a <a href="https://perfume-area.com" target="_blank">website</a> and easily translated into  many <a href="https://perfume-area.com/projects/perfume-area-launch" target="_blank">projects</a> (including readings and a book). It's nice to consider projects that have this fluidity, starting from a strong concept.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            For bonus points, try to incorporate some aspect of üçì fruit. (It can be subtle.)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Lightweight? üïä</h2>

    <p>
        If you search for ‚Äúlightweight websites‚Äù on the web, you will come across very *utilitarian* definitions of what lightweight sites are ‚Äî <a href="https://512kb.club" target="_blank">small</a> or even <a href="https://1mb.club">smaller</a> in file size. This is great ‚Äî as I am all for a web that is quickly loading, good for the environment, and accessible ‚Äî but this is a very literal definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this week's session, I want to extend the definition of lightweightness to a more *literary or feeling-based* one. I think lightweightness is about seeing the world in a new way. Maybe Italo Calvino, in his book <i>Six Memos for the Next Millennium</i>, said it best ‚Äî
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúWhenever humanity seems condemned to heaviness, I think I should fly like Perseus into a different space. I don‚Äôt mean escaping into dreams or into the irrational. I mean that I have to <span>change my approach</span>, <span>look at the world from a different perspective</span>, with a different logic and with <span>fresh methods of cognition</span> and verification. The images of lightness that I seek should not fade away like dreams dissolved by the realities of present and future...‚Äù
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I put some first examples in an <span style="font-size: 0.75em;">‚ú∂‚ú∂</span> Are.na Channel called <a href="https://www.are.na/laurel-schwulst/ultralight-websites" target="_blank">Ultralight Websites</a>. Could you help me add some?
    </p>
    <p class="gray">
        These are all websites I think are lightweight in the feeling-based way ‚Äî they have a strong concept, are relatively simple, and help me see the world in a new way ... many of them also happen to be literally lightweight, which might flow naturally from their concepts.
