        <p class="question">
          Why did you make <i>Mysterious Fruit</i>? Or how did it come to be?
        </p>
        <p>
          As I said the other time <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/people/editor-and-ceo-min-guhong-on-introducing-your-company/">you interviewed me</a>,  I like fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’re delicious, healthy, and also good looking. When traveling in other countries, I like eating fruits I’ve never seen before. I like to imagine their flavor before visiting and tasting.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not easy to imagine their flavor. But by surfing the web, I can get a little closer.
        </p>
        <p class="remark">
          Wow, reminds me of that documentary “<a href="https://youtu.be/b1aRgwWvIso">Fruit Hunters</a>” about rare fruits and the people who chase them.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          Can you tell me about your favorite lines of code from this project?
        </p>
        <p>
          To make <i>Mysterious Fruit</i>, I used three basic tools: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My favorite lines are in the HTML...
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/laurelschwulst/3ee87f7d51c2160c306522eb6372d28b.js"></script>
        <p>
          It’s fun to think about which HTML elements to use. This part shows the four pieces of Apple Emoji fruits. As you can see, I used <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> tag instead of <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> tag or <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag because it’s a list, and there’s no clear order in it. Since I like both literature and computers, sometimes such a list looks like a mysterious poem.
        </p>
        <p class="question">
          I noticed you included tomato in your JavaScript (line 18). Is a tomato really a fruit?
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/laurelschwulst/875b8fe087035020f30609138f030ae1.js"></script>
        <p>
          Good question. Some people say tomato is a fruit, others say it is not. Some people say both.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever the truth is, when I believe that tomato is fruit, it becomes a fruit for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can the web be fruitful? Can the web make us happy? The answer is the same. I believe that the important thing is to believe.
