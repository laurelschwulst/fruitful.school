        <h2>What do you want to learn in this course?</h2>
        <p>
          Well, I'm teaching, but I still hope to learn from everyone along the way. This class is graduate students, so they each have their own specific ways of making and working already. I hope to show them that once they have the basic
          confidence in making websites, for example, that it should be as natural as other mediums like drawing, painting, music-making, or any other creative practice. I also want to suggest ways that using a computer can be relaxing, highly
          personal, and maybe even spiritual. I also hope to learn more about the physicality of the internet. One thing I just did is install a server in my home. It‚Äôs like a local internet that‚Äôs only at my apartment‚Ä¶

        <h2>Share an early experience with computers or the internet.</h2>
        <p>
          I used to have a computer in my room in elementary school, but it didn‚Äôt have the internet. I would use Paint and make drawings while listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks. I really miss using a computer not connected to the internet.
          Strangely enough, I find myself setting timers nowadays so I can re-enter that special mood, even if only for a short while.

        <h2>What will the web look like in 10 years from now?</h2>
        <p>
          I honestly have no idea. Sometimes I don‚Äôt think it will be that different. But I think audio will be more important, and screens will be less and less important as we realize the damage we‚Äôre doing to our eyesight when a certain generation
          starts to go blind. If there are any screens, they will be e-ink and relaxing to look at. But right now I‚Äôm trying to engineer my next website so that it will be something I can use‚Ä¶ ten, twenty years into the future. Building something
          that will last is an interestingly difficult challenge, where on the web things can be so fast and quick.

        <h2>What‚Äôs your ideal learning environment like?</h2>
        <p>
          I think the most important thing is the energy in the environment. We should all be present, remembering why we're there, and why we want to learn. Aesthetically, it would be great if the classroom felt more like a living room...
          comfortable and beautiful and intimate, like we know whose space we're in. People can leave relics there from past learning, so we can learn from everyone past, whether they're present or not. I‚Äôd also like to see many different sitting and
          lounging options‚Ä¶ like chair, couch, desk, rug, pillows, etc. The lighting should be warm, incandescent bulb feeling. Maybe some candles around. Some musical instruments in case we get bored. A window to look outside, and a door to easily go outdoors and walk around‚Ä¶
