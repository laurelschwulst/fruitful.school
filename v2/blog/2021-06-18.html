      <p><b>Describe the process of creating your site.</b></p>
      <p>
        When you plant a seed, you don't know what it will become. It might
        emerge like the picture on the envelope but maybe it will sprout a
        monstrous other thing. It will probably sprout a monstrous other thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What did you learn through Fruitful School?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are materials, and that these materials have
        histories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>What's something you'd like visitors to know?</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is make-believe.</p>
      <p><b>What's it like to run a corporation?</b></p>
      <p>It is no big deal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What type of site would you like to see more on the www?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Less SquareSpace, Shopify, Wix, Weebly, and Cargo. More websites
        handmade on the QWERTY loom.
