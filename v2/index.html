                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> When and where are classes held? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br>Starting in Fall 2020 and continuing in Winter 2021, the workshop is 100% virtual. It happens wherever you are as long as you have a computer with a stable internet connection. The workshop will run for 6.5 weeks total and will meet synchronously twice a week: Wednesday evenings 7‚Äì8pm EST and Sunday afternoons 12‚Äì3pm EST. <br><br>Dates for Winter 2021 session: 2.7, 2.10, 2.14, 2.17, 2.21, 2.24, 2.28, 3.3, 3.7, 3.10, 3.14, 3.17, 3.21.</span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> Do I need any coding knowledge prior? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> No ... and it‚Äôs never too late to start! We view learning as a lifelong process, and we are excited to see how your previous experiences will inform what you create.</span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> What's Fruitful School‚Äôs approach to remote learning during the global pandemic? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> With care, optimism, and realness.<br><br>

                        We think it is up to us (the students, teachers, and guests of Fruitful School) to accept that the pandemic and remote learning is hard but also as an opportunity to be a portal to some new world. we are truly living and breathing the medium (websites!) in new and important ways with more people around the world.
                        <br><br>

                        We also want to continue to remember that we‚Äôre in a public health crisis. Let‚Äôs be empathetic to each other since none of us are truly "ok." We want to cultivate a caring, understanding, and supportive learning environment.<br><br>

                        We'll be limiting prolonged screen time in the workship itself. We'll be splitting up our meetings into two shorter sessions that re-occur weekly for 6 weeks. We'll be providing just as much synchronous work as asynchronous work. See you with your fruit and water ( stay hydrated! )</span></p>


                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> What will we do during each synchronous session? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> Lectures, discussions, demos/exercises, class workshopping and guidance.</span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> What will be provided for asynchronous time? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> references, links, videos, readings and more!</span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> How much does it cost? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> $1,500 ‚Äî note there are no scholarships this winter 2021 session left, but in future sessions we hope to have some half-priced spots</span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> Why does the workshop cost money? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br>

                        We're interested in building a sustainable school ‚Äî one that can continue over the years.<br><br>

                        We have  dreams for Fruitful School to be a place for many different ways to learn beyond the workshop. In the future, we would like to grant more people access to our materials ‚Äî both free and paid versions. By taking a workshop, you support us to continue Fruitful School.

                    </span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> Will there be future workshops? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> Yes. Subscribe for more updates.</span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> Will there be other ways to get involved? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> We're currently working on ways for people to get involved outside the workshop. We'll be making guides for our asynchronous learning materials. Think ‚Äúclass without the class‚Äù ‚Äî a digital publication you can follow at your own pace.<br><br>

                        We are currently working on the guides. Subscribe for updates.</span></p>

                <p class="press"><span aria-hidden="true">üçá</span> Why did you start this school? <sup class="expand">(+)</sup><sup class="disband" style="display:none">(‚Äì)</sup><span class="answer"><br><br> We love talking about, teaching and making websites! We‚Äôre hoping this can be a home to cultivate new ways of publishing to the www.<br><br>

                        We think this skill is even more needed than ever before. We are excited the workshop can be more accessible to those around the world through remote learning.

                Greetings,
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Happy December! Today we are announcing our Winter 2024 session of Fruitful School, which will be in-person in NYC in January & February.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                This session is a little different than those we‚Äôve done previously. What remains the same is our general theme of contemporary artistic practice engaging with the world wide web or technology at large. In other words, you can think of Fruitful School as a workshop for artists, designers, writers, programming who are curious about how their practice engages with technology today.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                For our Winter 2024 session, we are excited to announce two separate workshops:
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The first workshop is called ‚ÄúUltralight‚Äù and led by Laurel. It‚Äôs about creating lightweight websites that also consider time & space ‚Äî and explore topics including accessibility, sustainability, and formats. We‚Äôll cover basic HTML, CSS, some JavaScript, and a little physical computing. (January 14, 21, & 28)
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The second workshop, ‚ÄúNPC Artist,‚Äù is led by John. It‚Äôs about generative programming for the web ‚Äî exploring technical and conceptual areas of generative art. We‚Äôll utilize JavaScript and (‚Ä¶)  (February 4, 11, 18)
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Each workshop is three weeks long. Each of the three sessions will happen on Sunday afternoons (1-5pm) at Index Space in NYC (120 Walker Street).
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Each of these sessions is self-contained; that is, there will be lecture, demonstration, workshop, and sharing all within the course of four hours together. Participants will be present and ready to work in class and dialogue afterwards.
            </p>
